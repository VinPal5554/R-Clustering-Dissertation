# R-Clustering-Dissertation
This was my final year project at university where I explored how Artificial Intelligence techniques could be used to predict malware. Given the limited understanding and time I had, I decided that I would do this by comparing different clustering techniques against the Weighted Kappa metric. I also used data visualisation through the use of dendrograms, bar charts, and clusterplots. The clustering techniques that I used for this were K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and an attempted implementation of Robust Clustering.

Coming back to this project after graduating I realise that there were plenty of things I could have done differently such as staying within scope, understanding of clustering theory, R understanding, evaluating my results a little bit better, etc. Despite this I am very proud of what I managed to do by myself and can still remember the excitement I had back when I was making this.
